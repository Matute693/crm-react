- Project description

Project created with React version 18, I used the Vite framework and react router dom for the routing system, integration with REST API through JSON-SERVER to be able to display the results on the screen through HTTP requests with javascript fetch. Check for Error Boundaries coming from React. Use regular expressions to validate email. Creation of CRUD to be able to insert, update, delete and add new clients to our local REST API.
